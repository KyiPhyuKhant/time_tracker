# TimeTracker

A simple macOS SwiftUI app to track and log your daily work time, organized by date and project. You can add entries with a project code, subtask description, and duration, then view, edit, or delete them in a grouped sidebar.

## Features

* **Date-based grouping**: Sections for each day showing total time.
* **Project grouping**: Within each day, tasks are grouped by project code.
* **Entry management**: Add, edit, and delete individual entries.
* **Duration formatting**: Displays minutes or hours + minutes.

## Prerequisites

* macOS 11.0+ (Big Sur or later)
* Xcode 13.0+ with SwiftUI support
* Swift 5.5 or later
